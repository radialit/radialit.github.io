          <div class="hero__description">We are a policy innovation lab based at the University of Colorado, Boulder. We work with partners around the world to develop and support real-time policy experiments, establish robust networks for learning and exchange, and contribute to effective and durable policy outcomes.</div>

  <div class="projects">
      <div class="project">
        <p><span class="project__name">Governors’ Climate &amp; Forests Task Force (GCF)</span>: a unique subnational coalition of 35 states and provinces from nine different countries (Brazil, Colombia Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, and the United States) that seeks to advance jurisdictional programs for low emissions development and reduced emissions from deforestation and land use and link these activities with emerging greenhouse gas (GHG) compliance regimes and other pay-for- performance opportunities. To date, we have raised more than $8 million in grant funding for the GCF project and are about to close on a new 5-year, $5 million grant from the Norwegian Government. We have also secured a commitment from the Norwegian Government of $25 million for a separate GCF Fund. The project currently employs 4 people (three full-time, one part-time) at the law school and a network of country coordinators (all local NGOs) in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru. This project has considerable overlap with the expertise and interest of the incoming Law School Dean, Jim Anaya.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <p><span class="project__name">Public Utilities Commission Clean Energy Policy Collaborative Project</span>: a network of legal and policy academics in the United States focused on the role of state Public Utility Commissions in clean energy innovation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <p><span class="project__name">Sustainable LA Grand Challenge</span>: a project in collaboration with researchers at the UCLA School of Law comparing the role of municipal utilities and investor owned utilities in advancing distributed energy resources (rooftop solar, storage, electric vehicles) in Los Angeles.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <p><span class="project__name">Clean Energy for El Alto</span>: a pilot project in El Alto, Bolivia, one of Latin America’s fastest growing cities. Located in a subtropical highland environment over 13,000 feet above sea level with a population of 1,000,000 (85% indigenous and over 70% of its working population belongs to Bolivia’s “informal economy”) and 2,289 hours of sunshine per year, El Alto is an ideal site for developing innovative, affordable energy options, largely around solar power. This project unites clean energy development expertise from CU, the Catholic University of Bolivia (UCB), the Public University of El Alto, Bolivia (UPEA), and related partners. The project will develop pilot sites for clean energy solutions in El Alto and foster educational exchange between CU, UCB, UPEA and other project partners.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <p><span class="project__name">Acre-Colorado Exchange</span>: our first pilot exchange program will bring the Governor of Acre and his senior leadership to Boulder Colorado for two weeks in January 2017 for educational, commercial, and technical exchange.</p>
